**Angular JS BOILERPLATE**

Get started quick with angularJS.

	- clone repository into your local folder
	- install NPM modules (details below), if you do not already have them installed globally.
	- run tests to prove everything is working
		- $ grunt test
	- run gulp to package everything up for production.
		- $ gulp

The reason I created this boilerplate for angularJS : When I want to create a new site or app I do not want to spend my time setting up the bits and pieces for each instance. Performing a git clone speeds up my development and I have something to show the client before the day is over.

You can find other boilerplates under my github account at

*Get up and Running*

	You might also want to install Grunt, Karma and maybe even Yoeman globally so you don't have to keep installing it for every project. You can do that with the following commands.

	npm install -g grunt-cli

	npm install -g karma-cli

	The "cli" suffix is the package that allows grunt and karma to called directly from the command line in Windows. The -g parameter tells NPM you want to install the package globally.

Once you have installed grunt and karma 

	npm install
