**Angular JS BOILERPLATE**

Get started quick with angularJS.

	- clone repository into your local folder
	- install NPM modules (details below), if you do not already have them installed globally.
	- run tests to prove everything is working
		- $ grunt test
	- run gulp to package everything up for production.
		- $ gulp

The reason I created this boilerplate for angularJS : When I want to create a new site or app I do not want to spend my time setting up the bits and pieces for each instance. Performing a git clone speeds up my development and I have something to show the client before the day is over.
